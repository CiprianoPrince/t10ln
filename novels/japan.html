														misfortune after misfortune, culminating in an unlucky death during an
														incident on a school boat trip, trying to save a girl he barely knew. After death, he met a
														god of reincarnation who
														requested that the hundred or so dead passengers—one of them being the girl he tried in vain
														to save—be reincarnated
														into another world.

														Yet a series of unfortunate events forced Hiroto to reincarnate with even less luck than
														before, starting with nothing
														but a tremendous amount of Mana. His second life, far worse than his first, came to a cruel
														end.

														However, upon meeting the god a second time, he was informed that there would be yet another
														reincarnation—one that had
														already been set in motion and could not be stopped. Not wanting Hiroto to live long, the
														god cursed him before he was
														reborn in the hopes that he would either die quickly or commit su*cide.

														Hiroto was reborn once more as a half-Vampire, half-Dark Elf. A Dhampir. Not wanting a
														fourth life, he is determined to
														live this third life with the only things remaining from his previous lives—death-attribute
														magic and his enormous Mana
														pool.
